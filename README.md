# photoMatcher
Goal of photoMatcher is to create application to group photos based on similar date and maybe in the future based on similar "look".

It will be useful to put similar photos in new directories so I can choose which photo is nice and I whant to keep it. Maybe instead of creating new directories photoMatcher will open photos in some other application to choose photos I whant to keep.
